# Python PT - outline for Week 4: Tuesday, March 28, 2023

## Reminders:
- Please remember to get an early start with assignments and discussion topics every week!
- Don't forget about the 20-minute rule and Dojo Hall!
- Remember to read the material BEFORE the lecture that day!

## Core assignments this week:
- HTML Table
- Counter
- Dojo Survey
- Users CR

Need at least 15 out of 16 done total this course to satisfy this requirement and to be eligible for the exam at the end of week 6!

## IMPORTANT announcements:
- If you do Users CR first, make sure you submit that BEFORE working on Users CRUD Modularized!
- If you submit the Users CRUD Modularized assignment BEFORE submitting the Users CR assignment, make sure you submit for BOTH assignments!!  The same code for both is fine.
- Dojo Hall hours are changing starting Monday, April 3: 1 PM to 8 PM Pacific (still 11 AM to 8 PM Pacific through this Sunday).  TAs will be available on Discord starting at 11 AM Pacific, so you're encouraged to ask your channel in one of the channels.  Please keep the DMs to a minimum.

## Discussion topics reminder:
- Due Sunday by 11:59 PM Pacific!

Need at least 11 (recommended 12) out of 16 discussion topics to satisfy this requirement!

## Outline for today:
- Mid-track survey
- Create a modularized project from scratch (explanations will be either this Thursday or next Tuesday)
- GET vs. POST requests (HTTP request methods)
- Begin building our class project!
- Identify routes to build from wireframe
- Sending data from the form to the server
- Redirecting and why it's important
- Session
    - PSA: In the future, we'll use session primarily only for identifying who's logged in.  For today, we will use session for holding data from forms and to hold the companies we've added.  This is NOT what session should be used for; we're using session as a placeholder for a database until we tie in MySQL tomorrow.
